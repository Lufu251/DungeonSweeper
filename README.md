## Building

### Prerequisites
* **CMake** (3.15 or newer)
* **C++ Compiler** (e.g.,GCC, Clang, MSVC)
* **Git** (for fetching dependencies)
* **Emscripten SDK** (only for web builds)
* **Python 3.8+** (only for web builds)

### Desktop Build (Windows, macOS, Linux)
1. **Configure and build with CMake:**
    ```bash
    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ..
    cmake --build .
    ```
    The example binaries will be located in the `build/bin` directory.

### Web Build (WebAssembly)
1.  **Configure and build with Emscripten**
    ```bash
    cd tools
    ./build_web.sh
    ```
    Now there should be a HTTP Server running under port 8000 to test your project. The URL should be visible in the active terminal.
